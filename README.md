## Description

This Android application is developed as part of my thesis, aiming to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of retail. Built using Java and adhering to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, the app provides a streamlined platform for retail operations.

It's important to note that this project is currently a work in progress, serving as a minimum viable product. Over
time, it will undergo enhancements to bolster its robustness and scalability.
